## Sources
Official homicide data in Mexico is provided by the National Institute of Statistics and Geography (INEGI in spanish). the problem is that each year's official data takes long to get published due to the rigorous methodology it has to go through. 

What can be done if we want to answer questions regarding homicides in the recent months? Both INEGI and the Secretariat of Security and Civilian Protection (SSCP in spanish) make preliminary homicide data available. 

In total, we have three sources:

1. SSCP's interinstituttional group (2019 and 2020) 
2. SSCP's newspaper analysis (2019 and 2020, by gender)
3. INEGI's unnoficial data (2019)
